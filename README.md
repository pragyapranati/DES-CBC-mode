# DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD IN CIPHER BLOCK CHAINING MODE
This repository contains a C++ implementation of DES (Data Encryption Standard) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, along with SHA-1 hashing for verifying encrypted and decrypted output 
designed to demonstrate how symmetric encryption and cryptographic hash functions can be combined for secure data transmission.
